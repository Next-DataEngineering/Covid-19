# Covid-19


This repository is a theoritical project that aims to build dataframes bases on a person situation:
1- Healthy.
2- Suspect.
3- Confirmed.
4- Cured.

Track down their movements through geolocatization data, and with that simulate how will COVID-19 spread. 

All data will be invented so that no privacy laws are broken.
